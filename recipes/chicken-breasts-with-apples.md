# Chicken Breasts with Apples

The legend has it that pasta with tuna and tomato sauce is the "college-student recipe", since it is so easy and fast to prepare (you just boil the pasta and add the tuna and tomato from their cans).

This is an equally-simple recipe for busy people who dare to try something fancier. Also, it's very flexible, you can experiment changing some of the ingredients, adding more or even removing them!

I'll leave the amounts to you, just calculate for the amount of friends you want to invite home.

## Time (for 1 person)

- 10 minutes preparation
- 20 minutes cooking

## Ingredients

- Chicken breasts
- Apples
- Olive oil
- Your favourite beer. I use a dark beer, like Guinness or Leffe. But that's just me! I guess it also works with your favourite wine
- Curry powder
- Spices. I use something green, like oregano or basil. Use your favourite!

#Preparation

1. Heat enough oil in a **flat and wide** pan over low-medium heat. 
2. Meanwhile, cut the chicken breasts in little cubes (approx. thumbnail size).
3. When the oil is ready, add the chicken cubes.
4. Cut the apples in small cubes (approx. half-thumbnail size).
5. When the chicken starts to get a golden colour, add the apples.
6. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon to prevent the food from sticking to the pan.
7. When the apples have melt a bit, cover it all with beer, add the curry, and lower the heat. More stirring. You just made a fancy beer-pool party in your pan!
8. Once all the beer has evaporated, turn off the heat and add your favourite spice.

The idea behind cutting the chicken and the apples in small cubes is that, since chicken is a "dry" kind of meat, the apple pieces will melt a bit and produce some sort of juicy dough.

**Tip:** Serve with white rice and couscous.
